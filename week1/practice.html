<!-- For Week 1's assessment, we will be using the HTML we learned at the tutorial to create an personal website/auto-biography!
All the content required is covered in the tutorial notes for week1, but attached are some extra resources. -->


<!-- For this auto-briography, include the following:

    1) Start by making the HTML boilerplate. 
        - Resource: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-html5-template-boilerplate-code-example/
        - Hint: html:5 if you are using VS Code

    2) Use a <h1></h1> tag to write your name. Then use any smaller header tag to write the date
        - Resource: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_headings.asp
        
    3) Include an image of your favourite animal. Limit the width to 300px and add an alternate text incase the 
       image doesn't load.
        - Resource: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp 
    
    4) Write 2 short paragraphs about yourself, seperate each paragrpah with a line break. Include one anchor tag to anything!

    5) Create an ordered list about your top 3 favourite foods. Bonus: Instead of numbers, have it use uppercase 
       roman numerals

    6) For the final step feel free to add anything you please! If you have any questions ask a TA or Google. Have fun!
    
    7) If you wish, submit this file to the QWeb OnQ with any questions/concerns/ideas and the Education team can provide some further guidance.
