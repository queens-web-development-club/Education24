# QWEB Education 2023-2024
QWEB's Educational Materials for the 2023-2024 school year.  We provide two branches, the `main` branch where the starter code, current version of the website, and practice information are provided.   The `teaching-materials` branch provides all of the materials used in the weekly tutorials for QWEB: lecture notes, practice assignment example answers, and multiple versions of the code to display during the session.
